## yoo roblox 
Guys basically this thing is a roblox project we're working on atm and since I can't exactly test during school since yk chromebook and that I just have to script it here and then run it when I get back home. This is also learning grounds just in case Mr. DarkCloud finds anything he doesn't yet know (I say that because he is very smart guy and prob already knows everything lua)
